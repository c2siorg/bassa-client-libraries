This repository holds client libraries for [the Bassa project](https://github.com/scorelab/bassa). Bassa is an automated download queue for better usage of internet bandwidth for communities. It uses multi-threading to download files concurrently on to a local server and peers can download those files through a local area network without an external internet bandwidth.
